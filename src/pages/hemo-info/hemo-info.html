<p>Hemoglobin helps carry oxygen on red blood cells to the lungs in your body. Testosterone therapy can increase your levels of hemoglobin. Normal levels for males should range be between 14.0-18.0g g/dl.</p>

<p> If your levels become too high (>18.0 g/dl) this can cause side effects such as joint pain, itching, headache, fatigue, flushing, or even blurry vision. Elevated hemoglobin may cause your risk of a stroke or heart attack to greatly increase as your blood becomes “thicker” than normal. It is important to have your hemoglobin checked frequently to prevent any negative outcomes.</p>
