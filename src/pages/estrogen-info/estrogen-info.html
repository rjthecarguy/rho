<p>Estrogen is an important hormone in the body for both men and women. Men on TRT will often have increases in estrogen as it is a precursor to the creation of testosterone. Elevated estrogen can cause many symptoms such as edema, irritability, moodiness, weight gain, nipple sensitivity, and even gynecomastia. Low levels of estrogen hold several side effects as well, such as moodiness and worsened erectile dysfunction.
</p>


<p> Elevated estrogen may even increase the risk for a stroke. Unbalanced levels of estrogen can take away from the potential benefits of testosterone replacement. While under treatment with TRT, estrogen should be monitored very closely to prevent any of these side effects. Normal estrogen for males should range between 0-40 pg/ml. While under TRT your estrogen should range between 20-40 pg/ml.</p>
