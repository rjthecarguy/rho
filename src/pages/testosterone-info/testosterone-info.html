 Testosterone is the primary sex hormone in men. Many men are diagnosed with low testosterone or hypogonadism every year. Symptoms of low testosterone include: fatigue, weight gain, erectile dysfunction, low libido, moodiness, loss of enjoyment in life, and depression.</p>

 <p>Testosterone Replacement Therapy or TRT is the science of restoring menâ€™s low testosterone levels to normal physiological ranges. Men with total testosterone levels under 350 ng/dl may qualify for TRT. While under supervised TRT your total testosterone level should be brought above +500 ng/dl or higher to provide symptomatic relief of hypogonadal symptoms. It is important to have your levels monitored by trained professionals in the field of hormone replacement therapy. </p>
