<p> This test measures the activity in the prostate. Normal prostate levels should be between 0.00-4.00 ng/ml. A level above 4.0 ng/ml requires a urological evaluation. While under TRT this measurement may increase as testosterone begins to saturate the prostate. If your prostate increases too much it can lead to urinary changes or difficulties.</p>

<p> This test is often used as a marker for prostate cancer and is drawn at your initial consult. If your PSA level elevates more than 1.0 ng/ml in a year while under TRT further evaluation with a urologist may be warranted. </p>
