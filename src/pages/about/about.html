<h1>Welcome to BioEdge</h1>

<p>Our goal at BioEdge Medical is to provide our patients with industry
leading Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). This is done by utilizing
safe and effective medical treatments with trained providers in the field
of HRT. In addition, we offer other restorative medical services to help
our patients lead healthy and active lifestyles and achieve their optimal
health and well-being.</p>


<h1>The Leader in HRT</h1>


<p>There are several reasons why we are the leader in HRT in the Inland
Empire area. We have trained physicians and physician assistants in the
growing field of HRT. We have extensive knowledge of how to treat a
wide variety of patients and medical conditions. We have your SAFETY
in mind. We use in depth medical screening, frequent blood work, and
often weekly adjustments for you to get the most out of your treatment.
There is no “one size fits all” when it comes to HRT. We can custom tailor
your treatment plan to get the most benefits while reducing the overall
risks of therapy. Finally, we offer “concierge” style medicine that far
exceeds what you would expect from your primary care doctor.</p>
